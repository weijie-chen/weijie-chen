### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Weijie Chen. Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a **software engineer** specializing in Fintech risk monitoring systems. Previously, I worked as a **macroeconomic analyst/trader**, focusing on trading opportunities based on a global macro framework, particularly in currency and commodity markets. 

#### About My Training Materials:
These materials were initially used for new-hire training at my previous institution, where I also served as a macro analyst and quantitative instructor.
We organized internal training sessions for interns and new-hires, typically held from 7pm-11pm in our conference room.
The notes are designed to be approachable, requiring only a basic understanding of freshman-level math.
#### Important Note:
All institutional proprietary information and data have been removed from these training materials. Please refrain from asking for proprietary models or data due to my Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Feel free to explore my repositories, drop me a message, or add me on LinkedIn[https://www.linkedin.com/in/weijie-c-235814218/]. I'm always open to connecting with fellow professionals and enthusiasts.



| Course      | Description |
| :-----        |    :----:   |  
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Linear-Algebra-With-Python'>Linear Algebra with Python</a>      | This training will walk you through all the must-know concepts that set the foundation of data science or advanced quantitative skill sets. Suitable for statisticians, econometricians, quantitative analysts, data scientists, etc. to quickly refresh linear algebra with the assistance of Python computation and visualization. Core concepts covered are: <b>linear combination</b>,  <b>vector space,  <b>linear transformation</b>,  <b>eigenvalues</b> and <b>-vector</b>,  <b>diagnolization</b>,  <b>singular value decomposition</b>, etc.      |
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Basic-Statistics-With-Python'>Basic Statistics with Python</a>   | These notes aim to refresh the essential concepts of frequentist statistics, such as <b>descriptive statistics</b>, <b>parameter estimations</b>, <b>hypothesis testing</b>, <b>ANOVA</b> and etc. All codes are straightforward to understand. We were spending roughly three hours in total to cover all sections. | 
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Econometrics-With-Python'>Econometrics with Python</a>  | This is a crash course for reviewing the most important concepts and techniques of econometrics. The theories are presented lightly without hustles of mathematical derivation and Python codes are mostly procedural and straightforward. Core concepts covered: multi- <b>linear regression</b>,  <b>logistic model</b>,  <b>dummy variable</b>,  <b>simultaneous equations model</b>,  <b>panel data model</b> and  <b>time series</b>.        | 
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Time-Series-Analysis-With-Python'>Time Series, Financial Engineering and Algorithmic Trading with Python</a> |  This is a compound training sessions of time series analysis, financial engineering and algorithmic trading, the Part I covers basic time series concepts such as  <b>ARIMA</b>,      <b>GARCH</b> ans <b>(S)VAR</b>, also cover more advanced theory such as <b>State Space Model</b> and <b>Hidden Markov Chain</b>. The Part II covers the basics of financial engineering such <b>bond valueation</b>, <b>portfolio optimization</b>, <b>Black-Scholes model</b> and various stochatic process models. The Part III will demonstrate the practicalities, e.g. <b>algorithmic trading</b>. The training will try to explain the mathematical mechanism behind each theory, rather than forcing you to memorize a bunch of black box operations.    | 
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Bayesian-Statistics-Econometrics'>Bayesian Statistics with Python</a>  | Bayesian statistics is the last pillar of quantitative framework, also the most challenging subject. The course will explore the algorithms of <b>Markov chain Monte Carlo</b> (MCMC), specifically <b>Metropolis-Hastings</b>, <b>Gibbs Sampler</b> and etc., we will build up our own toy model from crude Python functions. In the meanwhile, we will cover the PyMC3, which is a library for probabilistic programming specializing in Bayesian statistics.|
