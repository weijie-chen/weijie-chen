### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Weijie Chen.

I am a **macroeconomic analyst/trader** seeking for trading opportunities based on global macro framework, my favorite markets are currency and commodity.<br><br>
I am also a fervent **quantitative researcher**, exploring in Bayesian time series and machine learning framework for short turn profit gain. 

The training materials in Github are 100% written by myself, used to be for new-hire training in my previous institute. Regularly I give training sessions to junior analysts or students who are interested in quantitative trading or research.
