### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Weijie Chen.

I am a **macroeconomic analyst/trader** seeking for trading opportunities based on global macro framework, my favorite markets are currency and commodity.<br><br>
I am also a fervent **quantitative researcher**, exploring in Bayesian time series and machine learning framework for short turn profit gain. 

The training materials in my Github pages are completely written by myself, used to be for new-hire training in my previous institute (I was both a macro analyst and quantitative instructor in a boutique hedge fund). We used to organize internal training sessions for interns and new-hires to ensure they are on the same page with us, usually these trainings are intensive (commonly last from 7pm-11pm after work). Though never intended as a substitution of formal education from universities, some of my academic friends are using my training material in their university's lectures too.

All institutional proprietary information and data has been cleared.
