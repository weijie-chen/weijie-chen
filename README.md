### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Weijie Chen.

I am a **macroeconomic analyst/trader** seeking for trading opportunities based on global macro framework, my favorite markets are currency and commodity.<br><br>

The training materials in my Github repositories were written by me, used to be new-hire training materials in my previous institution (I was both a macro analyst and quantitative instructor in a tiny hedge fund, unfortunately defunct already). We used to organize internal training sessions for interns and new-hires, usually these trainings were held from 7pm-11pm in our conference room. The notes are not difficult, with a freshman math education would be enough to walk through on your own.

Please note that all institutional proprietary information and data has been cleared from training materials. So please do not ask me my institution's proprietary models or data, which unfortunately cannot be disclosed due to Non-Disclosure Agreement. 

| Course      | Description |
| :-----        |    :----:   |  
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Linear-Algebra-With-Python'>Linear Algebra with Python</a>      | This training will walk you through all the must-know concepts that set the foundation of data science or advanced quantitative skill sets. Suitable for statisticians, econometricians, quantitative analysts, data scientists, etc. to quickly refresh linear algebra with the assistance of Python computation and visualization. Core concepts covered are: <b>linear combination</b>,  <b>vector space,  <b>linear transformation</b>,  <b>eigenvalues</b> and <b>-vector</b>,  <b>diagnolization</b>,  <b>singular value decomposition</b>, etc.      |
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Basic-Statistics-With-Python'>Basic Statistics with Python</a>   | These notes aim to refresh the essential concepts of frequentist statistics, such as <b>descriptive statistics</b>, <b>parameter estimations</b>, <b>hypothesis testing</b>, <b>ANOVA</b> and etc. All codes are straightforward to understand. We were spending roughly three hours in total to cover all sections. | 
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Econometrics-With-Python'>Econometrics with Python</a>  | This is a crash course for reviewing the most important concepts and techniques of econometrics. The theories are presented lightly without hustles of mathematical derivation and Python codes are mostly procedural and straightforward. Core concepts covered: multi- <b>linear regression</b>,  <b>logistic model</b>,  <b>dummy variable</b>,  <b>simultaneous equations model</b>,  <b>panel data model</b> and  <b>time series</b>.        | 
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Time-Series-Analysis-With-Python'>Time Series, Financial Engineering and Algorithmic Trading with Python</a> |  This is a compound training sessions of time series analysis, financial engineering and algorithmic trading, the Part I covers basic time series concepts such as  <b>ARIMA</b>,      <b>GARCH</b> ans <b>(S)VAR</b>, also cover more advanced theory such as <b>State Space Model</b> and <b>Hidden Markov Chain</b>. The Part II covers the basics of financial engineering such <b>bond valueation</b>, <b>portfolio optimization</b>, <b>Black-Scholes model</b> and various stochatic process models. The Part III will demonstrate the practicalities, e.g. <b>algorithmic trading</b>. The training will try to explain the mathematical mechanism behind each theory, rather than forcing you to memorize a bunch of black box operations.    | 
| <a href='https://github.com/weijie-chen/Bayesian-Statistics-Econometrics'>Bayesian Statistics with Python</a>  | Bayesian statistics is the last pillar of quantitative framework, also the most challenging subject. The course will explore the algorithms of <b>Markov chain Monte Carlo</b> (MCMC), specifically <b>Metropolis-Hastings</b>, <b>Gibbs Sampler</b> and etc., we will build up our own toy model from crude Python functions. In the meanwhile, we will cover the PyMC3, which is a library for probabilistic programming specializing in Bayesian statistics.|
